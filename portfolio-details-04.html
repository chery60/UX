                <p class="portfolio-description mt-30">We have observed that users have encountered many issues with the current Food.com website. Getting a cooking video based on the available ingredients and the absence of ordering the required product was given a difficult experience for the user. Due to its complex process, end users found it difficult to understand. Therefore, users needed to scroll through the entire website to know how which recipe can be made at present with the ingredients which are present at home.</p>
                 <!-- /portfolio-description -->
                <p class="portfolio-description mt-30">So we decided to give the best possible solution where users can get cooking videos based on the availability of the ingredients and add a shopping cart to order the required ingredients without any hassle.</p>
